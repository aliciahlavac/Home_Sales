# Home_Sales
Module 22 Challenge

In this project, I performed a series of data analysis tasks using PySpark, which is a powerful framework for handling big data with Apache Spark and Python. The Jupyter Notebook associated with the work done (originally in Google Colab) is [Home_Sales.ipynb](https://github.com/aliciahlavac/Home_Sales/blob/main/Home_Sales.ipynb), and it uses Spark 3.5.0, which is a change from the original starter code.  In this notebook, I imported the necessary PySpark SQL functions that would be essential for my data manipulation and querying tasks.
